# 🏥 Healthcare Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes patient healthcare records to uncover **disease trends, billing patterns, and health risk factors**.  
By examining **Medical Conditions, Test Results, Billing Amounts, Age, and Gender**, the project provides valuable insights for healthcare providers and researchers.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify the **most common medical conditions** in the dataset.
- Analyze **average billing amounts** across different diseases.
- Track **trends in hospital admissions over time**.
- Study **gender-based patterns** in medical conditions.
- Explore correlations between **Age, Billing Amount, and Length of Stay (LOS)**.
- Apply **statistical testing (ANOVA)** to check if billing differs significantly across conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (data visualization)
- **SciPy** (statistical analysis - ANOVA test)
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Key Analyses & Visualizations
- Distribution of medical conditions
- Gender distribution of patients
- Age distribution histogram
- Test results breakdown
- Average billing by disease
- Condition-by-gender patterns
- Monthly admissions trend (time series)
- Correlation heatmap (Age, Billing, LOS)
- ANOVA test for billing differences across conditions
- Boxplot of billing by medical condition
